# Introducing StudioCMS: A Community-Driven CMS for Astro DB

As part of our efforts, we're excited to introduce StudioCMS - a dedicated content management system (CMS) built on top of Astro's latest feature, [Astro DB](https://studio.astro.build). This project was developed by [Adam](https://github.com/Adammatthiesen), [Dreyfus](https://github.com/dreyfus92), and [Jumper](https://github.com/jdtjenkins), three passionate members of the Astro community.

## Why another CMS?

While Astro's content capabilities are powerful, we recognized a need for a more streamlined and user-friendly CMS solution within the Astro ecosystem. Many Astro users, especially those coming from more traditional CMS backgrounds, have expressed a desire for a dedicated CMS that can seamlessly integrate with Astro projects.

StudioCMS was born out of this need, providing a content management platform that is tailor-made for Astro. By building on top of Astro DB, we're able to offer a CMS experience that feels native to the Astro workflow, making it easier for both developers and content creators to collaborate on Astro-powered projects.

## An Experimental Endeavor

It's important to note that StudioCMS is an experimental project that heavily relies on the `@astrojs/db` package, which is currently in active development and not yet considered stable. As a result, you should expect a significant number of breaking changes as the project continues to evolve.

We believe that by building on the cutting-edge features of Astro DB, we can create a powerful and innovative CMS solution. However, this also means that StudioCMS may not be suitable for mission-critical or production-ready projects at this stage. We encourage you to use caution and thoroughly test the CMS in your own projects before deploying it to a live environment.


## Leveraging the Power of Astro

StudioCMS is built from the ground up to seamlessly integrate with Astro's robust and efficient framework. By harnessing the power of Astro, we've created a CMS solution that aligns perfectly with the Astro ecosystem, providing a solid foundation for building and scaling Astro-powered applications.

## Key Features

**Astro Foundation:** StudioCMS leverages Astro's robust and efficient framework, providing a solid base for building and scaling applications.

**Enhanced Markdown:** We've incorporated 'Marked' with support for extensions, enriching the markdown experience with greater flexibility and functionality.

**Shiki Syntax Highlighting:** StudioCMS offers Shiki-powered syntax highlighting, ensuring your code is both visually appealing and easy to read. This is especially useful in non-Cloudflare environments due to bundle size considerations.

**Markdoc Integration:** In addition to 'Marked', StudioCMS provides an alternative with Markdoc, offering users a choice for their markdown processing needs.

**Built-in Authentication:** StudioCMS features built-in authentication with support for multiple platforms, including Local and Github, enhancing security and user management (currently in development).

**Unpic Image Service:** StudioCMS includes a free and efficient image service, Unpic, which makes managing external URLs straightforward, with support for major CDNs.

## A Community-Driven Effort

At the heart of Astrolicious is a deep commitment to community involvement and collaboration. We believe that the development of StudioCMS should be a collective effort, drawing on the diverse talents and perspectives of the Astro community.

To that end, we've handed the repository Astrolicious as an open organization, welcoming contributors of all skill levels to get involved and help shape the future of this CMS. Whether you're a seasoned Astro developer or new to the ecosystem, we encourage you to join our [Discord server](https://chat.astrolicious.dev/) and explore ways to contribute.

By fostering a sense of shared ownership and investment, we aim to create a CMS that truly reflects the needs and desires of the Astro community. Your feedback, ideas, and code contributions will be invaluable as we work to build a feature-rich and user-friendly content management solution for Astro.

So don't be a stranger - come join us on this journey and help us realize the full potential of StudioCMS!

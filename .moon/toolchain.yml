  # Optional fields for defining package manager specific configuration. The chosen setting is dependent on the value of node.packageManager. If these settings are not defined, the latest version of the active package manager will be used (when applicable).
  # pnpm:
  
  # The version setting defines the explicit package manager version specification to use. If this field is not defined, the global npm, pnpm, yarn, and bun binaries will be used.

  # When syncing project dependencies, customize the format that will be used for the dependency version range. The following formats are supported (but use the one most applicable to your chosen package manager):

  # - file (npm default) - Uses file:../relative/path and copies package contents.
  # - link - Uses link:../relative/path and symlinks package contents.
  # - star - Uses an explicit *.
  # - version - Uses the explicit version from the dependent project's package.json, e.g., "1.2.3".
  # - version-caret - Uses the version from the dependent project's package.json as a caret range, e.g., "^1.2.3".
  # - version-tilde - Uses the version from the dependent project's package.json as a tilde range, e.g., "~1.2.3".
  # - workspace (bun/pnpm/yarn default) - Uses workspace:*, which resolves to "1.2.3". Requires package workspaces.
  # - workspace-caret - Uses workspace:^, which resolves to "^1.2.3". Requires package workspaces.
  # - workspace-tilde - Uses workspace:~, which resolves to "~1.2.3". Requires package workspaces.
  # 
  # This setting does not apply to peer dependencies, as they will always use a format of ^<major>.0.0. Furthermore, if a package manager does not support a chosen format, it will fallback to another format!
  dependencyVersionFormat: workspace


  # Will infer and automatically create tasks from package.json scripts.
  #
  # This requires the project's language to be "javascript" or "typescript", a package.json to exist in the project, and will take the following into account:
  #
  # Script names will be converted to kebab-case, and will become the task ID.
  # Pre, post, and life cycle hooks are ignored.
  # Tasks defined in .moon/tasks.yml or moon.yml take precedence over scripts of the same name.

  # Supports the "single version policy" or "one version rule" patterns by only allowing dependencies in the root package.json, and only installing dependencies in the workspace root, and not within individual projects. It also bypasses all workspaces checks to determine package locations.

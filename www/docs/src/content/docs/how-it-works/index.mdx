# Introduction

StudioCMS is a powerful CMS built for Astro that allows you to manage and serve your content using [Astro DB](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/astro-db/). It's designed to be easy-to-use and flexible enough to handle any type of content.

Extending StudioCMS is easy too! You can create your own plugins to add new features to StudioCMS.

## How does it work?

StudioCMS is divided into multiple parts:

- **studiocms**: The primary integration that hooks into your Astro project and provides the ability to interact with Astro DB (through the `@astrojs/db` integration).
- **@studiocms/core**: The core integration that provides the foundation for StudioCMS. It provides the database configurations, and adds various features including virtual imports, logging, etc.
- **@studiocms/auth**: An integration that provides authentication configuration options for the StudioCMS Dashboard.
- **@studiocms/assets**: An integration that provides the assets for the StudioCMS Dashboard.
- **@studiocms/frontend**: An integration that provides the frontend layouts and components for the StudioCMS ecosystem.
- **@studiocms/renderers**: An integration that provides the renderers for the StudioCMS ecosystem.
- **@studiocms/dashboard**: The primary web interface for managing your StudioCMS project. It provides a user-friendly interface for creating, editing, and deleting content.
- **@studiocms/imagehandler**: An integration that provides a `<CustomImage />` component to handle remote images and optimize them for your project in an SSR environment.
- **@studiocms/robotstxt**: An integration that automates the creation of a `robots.txt` file for your StudioCMS project.
- **@studiocms/betaresources**: An integration that provides resources for the StudioCMS beta.

## Breakdown

### StudioCMS Core

StudioCMS Core is an Astro Integration which provides a comprehensive CMS solution out-of-the-box. This integration registers StudioCMS as the first plugin, sets up database configurations, watches for configuration changes, and adds various features including virtual imports, logging, and default frontend routes.

#### Features

- **@astrojs/db**: StudioCMS Core uses the `@astrojs/db` integration to connect to a libSQL database.
- **Virtual Imports**: StudioCMS Core adds several [virtual modules](https://vitejs.dev/guide/api-plugin#virtual-modules-convention) packed with features that give you full control over your dynamic content.
- **Logging**: StudioCMS Core logs all changes to Astro Studio. This can be enabled in your config file.
- **Default Frontend Routes**: The StudioCMS Core integration adds default frontend routes to your Astro project to allow for easy access to the StudioCMS dashboard.
- **Plugin System**: You can extend StudioCMS using plugins to add additional functionality.

#### Core Virtual Modules

:::tip
Modules prefixed with `virtual:` are virtual modules that are primarily used internally by StudioCMS, but can be used by developers to access StudioCMS data.  To access these modules with proper typings, see the [project development `.d.ts` file](https://github.com/astrolicious/studiocms/blob/main/packages/studiocms_core/virtuals.d.ts) for an example of how to configure your project to sense these types.

Modules without the `virtual:` prefix have full typings defined and injected into your project's `.astro/` directory automatically, and can be accessed directly without any extra configuration.

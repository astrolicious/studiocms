## Let's get started

To start using Astro StudioCMS, you'll need:

- An Astro Studio account
- A Studio project
- A bootstrapped Astro project
- The Astro StudioCMS integration

## Creating an Astro Studio account

You can create an Astro Studio account by visiting [Astro Studio](https://studio.astro.build/).

Once created, you'll be able to access the Astro Studio dashboard and manage your projects.

## Creating a new Studio project

There are two ways to create a project in Astro Studio:

To get started go to your personal dashboard within Studio and click the "Start a Project" button and follow the instructions. Astro Studio will connect to your GitHub repository and create a new hosted database for your project.

**Use the Astro Studio CLI** to create from any local Astro project. You can run the following commands to get started:

    <PackageManagerTabs>
        <Fragment slot="npm">
        ```shell
        # Log in to Astro Studio with your GitHub account
        npx astro login

        # Link to a new project by following the prompts
        npx astro link

        # (Optional) Push your local db configuration to the remote database
        npx astro db push
        ```
        </Fragment>
        <Fragment slot="pnpm">
        ```shell
        # Log in to Astro Studio with your GitHub account
        pnpm astro login

        # Link to a new project by following the prompts
        pnpm astro link

        # (Optional) Push your local db configuration to the remote database
        pnpm astro db push
        ```
        </Fragment>
        <Fragment slot="yarn">
        ```shell
        # Log in to Astro Studio with your GitHub account
        yarn astro login

        # Link to a new project by following the prompts
        yarn astro link

        # (Optional) Push your local db configuration to the remote database
        yarn astro db push
        ```
        </Fragment>
    </PackageManagerTabs>

    Once you are logged in and linked successfully, you can run all Astro DB commands to manage your remote database. 

    :::note
    See [the Astro DB CLI reference](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/db/#astro-db-cli-reference) for all available commands.
    :::

## Bootstrapping an Astro project

To create a new Astro project, simply run the following command in your terminal:

<PackageManagerTabs>
  <Fragment slot="npm">
  ```shell
  # Create a new project with npm
  npm create astro@latest
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="pnpm">
  ```shell
  # Create a new project with pnpm
  pnpm create astro@latest
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="yarn">
  ```shell
  # Create a new project with yarn
  yarn create astro
  ```
  </Fragment>
</PackageManagerTabs>

After running the command, you'll be prompted to answer a few questions about your project. Once completed, the CLI will create a new Astro project in the specified directory.

If all goes well, you should see a “Liftoff confirmed. Explore your project!” message followed by some recommended next steps. cd into your new project directory to begin using Astro.

If you skipped the npm install step during the CLI wizard, then be sure to install your dependencies before continuing.

## Adding the Astro StudioCMS integration

To add the Astro StudioCMS integration to your project, you'll need to install the Astro StudioCMS package:

<PackageManagerTabs>
  <Fragment slot="npm">
  ```shell
  npm astro add @astrolicious/studiocms db node
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="pnpm">
  ```shell
  pnpm astro add @astrolicious/studiocms db node
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="yarn">
  ```shell
  yarn astro add @astrolicious/studiocms db node
  ```
  </Fragment>
</PackageManagerTabs>

After installing the package, you'll need to make sure that your `astro.config.mjs` file looks like this:

```js title="astro.config.mjs"
import db from '@astrojs/db';
import node from '@astrojs/node';
import studioCMS from '@astrolicious/studiocms';
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';

export default defineConfig({
    site: 'https://demo.astro-studiocms.xyz/',
    output: 'server',
    adapter: node({ mode: "standalone" }),
    integrations: [
        db(),
        studioCMS({
            dbStartPage: false,
        }),
    ],
});
```

:::note
Astro StudioCMS requires SSR mode to work correctly. Make sure to set `output: 'server'` and an adapter that supports SSR in your `astro.config.mjs` file.
:::

### Running your Astro project

To start your Astro project, run the following command in your terminal:

<PackageManagerTabs>
  <Fragment slot="npm">
  ```shell
  npm run dev
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="pnpm">
  ```shell
  pnpm run dev
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="yarn">
  ```shell
  yarn dev
  ```
  </Fragment>
</PackageManagerTabs>

After running the command, you should see a message indicating that your project is running at `localhost:4321`. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4321` to see your Astro project in action.

**Congratz!** 🥳 You now have Astro StudioCMS installed in your Astro project.

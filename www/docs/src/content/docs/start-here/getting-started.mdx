## Let's get started

To start using StudioCMS, you'll need:

- An Astro project
- A libSQL provider or self-hosted libSQL server
- The StudioCMS integration

## Understanding Options for `@astrojs/db`

### Using libSQL

With the latest version of `@astrojs/db` (`v0.14.0`), you can now link to any libSQL server from any platform that exposes the libSQL remote protocol of the server, or can be self-hosted.

To use libSQL with Astro Db, you will need to set the following environment variables:

- **`ASTRO_DB_REMOTE_URL`** - The connection URL to your libSQL server
- **`ASTRO_DB_APP_TOKEN`** - The app token for your libSQL server

<ReadMore>For more information about these environment varibales, see [Using libSQL with @astrojs/db](/start-here/environment-variables/#if-using-libsql-with-astrojsdb)</ReadMore>

<ReadMore>See Astro's [Astro DB LibSQL Docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/astro-db/#libsql) for more information</ReadMore>

## Creating a new Astro project

To create a new Astro project, simply run the following command in your terminal:

    <PackageManagers type="create" pkg="astro@latest" />

After running the command, you'll be prompted to answer a few questions about your project. Once completed, the CLI will create a new Astro project in the specified directory.

If all goes well, you should see a ‚ÄúLiftoff confirmed. Explore your project!‚Äù message followed by some recommended next steps.

`cd` into your new project directory to begin using Astro. 

```bash
cd my-project
```

If you skipped the npm install step during the CLI wizard, then be sure to install your dependencies before continuing.

## Adding the StudioCMS integration

To add the StudioCMS integration to your project, you'll need to install the Astro StudioCMS package and it's dependencies:

    <PackageManagers type="exec" pkg="astro" args="add db node studiocms" />

After installing the package, make sure that your `astro.config.mjs` file is correctly importing and calling the integration:

```ts twoslash
import db from '@astrojs/db';
import node from '@astrojs/node';
import studioCMS from 'studiocms';
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';

export default defineConfig({
    site: 'https://demo.astro-studiocms.xyz/',
    output: 'server',
    adapter: node({ mode: "standalone" }),
    integrations: [
        db(),
        studioCMS({
            dbStartPage: true, // After the first time running the dev server and following the instructions at http://localhost:4321/start this will be set to false.
        }),
    ],
});
```

<Aside type="note" title="SSR Only">
StudioCMS requires SSR mode to work correctly. Make sure to set `output: 'server'` and an adapter that supports SSR in your `astro.config.mjs` file.
</Aside>

## Configure your `package.json` scripts

Setup your `package.json` scripts to include the `--remote` flag for build, and optionally for dev. (You can also run the dev command as shown in the ["Running your StudioCMS Project"](#running-your-studiocms-project) section)

```json /--remote/
// package.json
{
    "name": "my-studiocms-project",
    "scripts": {
        "dev": "astro dev --remote",
        "build": "astro check & astro build --remote",
        "astro": "astro"
    }
}
```

## Running your StudioCMS project

Thanks to the power of Astro running StudioCMS is as easy as running the dev command for local preview, or building and deploying to your server, for the basics of how to use it locally without building here is what you need to do.

### First time Setup (or during updates if the tables schema is updated)

To start your Astro project, run the following commands in your terminal:

    <PackageManagers type="exec" args="astro db push --remote" />
    <PackageManagers type="run" args="dev --remote # '--remote' can be removed if you have set the scripts in your package.json" />

After running the commands, you should see a message indicating that your project is running at `localhost:4321`. When first setting up StudioCMS, you will prompted to finish configuring StudioCMS at http://localhost:4321/start

### Running in Astro Development mode locally

To start your Astro project, run the following command in your terminal:

    <PackageManagers type="run" args="dev --remote" />

After running the command, you should see a message indicating that your project is running at `localhost:4321`. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4321` to see your Astro project in action.

**Congratulations!** ü•≥ You now have StudioCMS installed in your Astro project.

## Next steps

Now that you have StudioCMS installed, you can start building your project with StudioCMS.

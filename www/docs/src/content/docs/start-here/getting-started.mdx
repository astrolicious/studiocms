## Let's get started

To start using Astro StudioCMS, you'll need:

- An Astro project
- An Astro Studio account
- An Astro Studio project
- The Astro StudioCMS integration

## Creating an Astro Studio account

:::note
Astro Studio is currently in closed beta. You'll need an invite to create an account.

We're following Astro Studio's News and Updates for the latest information on when the platform will be available to the public again and will be informing everyone through our [Discord channel](https://chat.astro-studiocms.xyz) when signups for Astro Studio are open again. There is also an open [PR for `@astrojs/db`](https://github.com/withastro/astro/pull/11385) that would allow you to use the Astro StudioCMS integration without the need for Astro Studio by using another LibSQL database service or even self-hosted.
:::

You can create an Astro Studio account by visiting [Astro Studio](https://studio.astro.build/).

Once created, you'll be able to access the Astro Studio dashboard and manage your projects.

## Creating a new Studio project

There are two ways to create a project in Astro Studio:

To get started go to your personal dashboard within Studio and click the "Start a Project" button and follow the instructions. Astro Studio will connect to your GitHub repository and create a new hosted database for your project.

**Use the Astro Studio CLI** to create from any local Astro project. You can run the following commands to get started:

    <PackageManagers type="exec" pkg="astro" args="db login" comment="Log in to Astro Studio with your GitHub account"/>
    <PackageManagers type="exec" pkg="astro" args="db link" comment="Link to a new project by following the prompts"/>
    <PackageManagers type="exec" pkg="astro" args="db push" comment="Push your local db configuration to the remote database"/>

    Once you are logged in and linked successfully, you can run all Astro DB commands to manage your remote database. 

:::note
See [the Astro DB CLI reference](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/db/#astro-db-cli-reference) for all available commands.
:::

## Creating a new Astro project

To create a new Astro project, simply run the following command in your terminal:

    <PackageManagers type="create" pkg="astro@latest" />

After running the command, you'll be prompted to answer a few questions about your project. Once completed, the CLI will create a new Astro project in the specified directory.

If all goes well, you should see a ‚ÄúLiftoff confirmed. Explore your project!‚Äù message followed by some recommended next steps.

`cd` into your new project directory to begin using Astro. `cd my-project`

If you skipped the npm install step during the CLI wizard, then be sure to install your dependencies before continuing.

## Adding the Astro StudioCMS integration

To add the Astro StudioCMS integration to your project, you'll need to install the Astro StudioCMS package and it's dependencies:

    <PackageManagers type="exec" pkg="astro" args="add db node studiocms" />

After installing the package, make sure that your `astro.config.mjs` file is correctly importing and calling the integration:

```js title="astro.config.mjs"
import db from '@astrojs/db';
import node from '@astrojs/node';
import studioCMS from 'studiocms';
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';

export default defineConfig({
    site: 'https://demo.astro-studiocms.xyz/',
    output: 'server',
    adapter: node({ mode: "standalone" }),
    integrations: [
        db(),
        studioCMS({
            dbStartPage: true, // After the first time running the dev server and following the instructions at http://localhost:4321/start this will be set to false.
        }),
    ],
});
```

:::note
Astro StudioCMS requires SSR mode to work correctly. Make sure to set `output: 'server'` and an adapter that supports SSR in your `astro.config.mjs` file.
:::

## Configure your `package.json` scripts

Setup your `package.json` scripts to include the `--remote` flag for build, and optionally for dev. (You can also run the dev command as shown in the ["Running your StudioCMS Project"](#running-your-studiocms-project) section)

```json title="package.json"
{
    "name": "my-studiocms-project",
    "scripts": {
        "dev": "astro dev --remote",
        "build": "astro check & astro build --remote",
        "astro": "astro"
    }
}
```

## Running your StudioCMS project

Thanks to the power of Astro running StudioCMS is as easy as running the dev command for local preview, or building and deploying to your server, for the basics of how to use it locally without building here is what you need to do.

### First time Setup (or during updates if the tables schema is updated)

To start your Astro project, run the following commands in your terminal:

    <PackageManagers type="exec" args="astro db link" />
    <PackageManagers type="exec" args="astro db push" />
    <PackageManagers type="run" args="dev --remote" />

After running the commands, you should see a message indicating that your project is running at `localhost:4321`. When first setting up StudioCMS, you will prompted to finish configuring StudioCMS at http://localhost:4321/start

### Running in Astro Development mode locally

To start your Astro project, run the following command in your terminal:

    <PackageManagers type="run" args="dev --remote" />

After running the command, you should see a message indicating that your project is running at `localhost:4321`. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4321` to see your Astro project in action.

**Congratulations!** ü•≥ You now have Astro StudioCMS installed in your Astro project.

## Let's get started

To start using StudioCMS, you'll need:

- An Astro project
- An Astro Studio account or (*Self*) Hosted libSQL server
- The Astro StudioCMS integration

## Understanding Options for `@astrojs/db`

### Using libSQL

With the latest version of `@astrojs/db` (`v0.14.0`), you can now link to any libSQL server from any platform that exposes the libSQL remote protocol of the server, or can be self-hosted.

To use libSQL with Astro Db, you will need to set the following environment variables:

- **`ASTRO_DB_REMOTE_URL`** - The connection URL to your libSQL server
- **`ASTRO_DB_APP_TOKEN`** - The app token for your libSQL server

<ReadMore>For more information about these environment varibales, see [Using libSQL with @astrojs/db](/start-here/environment-variables/#if-using-libsql-with-astrojsdb)</ReadMore>

The [commands for deploying and pushing changes](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/astro-db/#deploy-with-a-studio-connection) to your database are the same when using libSQL as when connecting to an Astro Studio hosted database. However, both of your environment variables need to be set locally when running commands with the `--remote` option like `astro build` and `astro db push`.

<ReadMore>See Astro's [Astro DB LibSQL Docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/astro-db/#libsql) for more information</ReadMore>

### Using Astro Studio
</StudioHeading>

<Aside type="note" title="Closed Beta">
Astro Studio is currently in closed beta. If you have not already been invited, then unfortunently you will need to wait until it re-opens, or if you do not have an account, you can use the [libSQL option](#using-libsql) to get started using another libSQL provider.

#### Creating an Astro Studio account
</StudioHeading>

You can create an Astro Studio account by visiting [Astro Studio](https://studio.astro.build/).

Once created, you'll be able to access the Astro Studio dashboard and manage your projects.

#### Creating a new Studio project
</StudioHeading>

There are two ways to create a project in Astro Studio:

To get started go to your personal dashboard within Studio and click the "Start a Project" button and follow the instructions. Astro Studio will connect to your GitHub repository and create a new hosted database for your project.

**Use the Astro Studio CLI** to create from any local Astro project. You can run the following commands to get started:

    <PackageManagers type="exec" pkg="astro" args="db login" comment="Log in to Astro Studio with your GitHub account"/>
    <PackageManagers type="exec" pkg="astro" args="db link" comment="Link to a new project by following the prompts"/>
    <PackageManagers type="exec" pkg="astro" args="db push" comment="Push your local db configuration to the remote database"/>

    Once you are logged in and linked successfully, you can run all Astro DB commands to manage your remote database. 

<ReadMore>See [the Astro DB CLI reference](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/db/#astro-db-cli-reference) for all available commands.</ReadMore>

## Creating a new Astro project

To create a new Astro project, simply run the following command in your terminal:

    <PackageManagers type="create" pkg="astro@latest" />

After running the command, you'll be prompted to answer a few questions about your project. Once completed, the CLI will create a new Astro project in the specified directory.

If all goes well, you should see a ‚ÄúLiftoff confirmed. Explore your project!‚Äù message followed by some recommended next steps.

`cd` into your new project directory to begin using Astro. `cd my-project`

If you skipped the npm install step during the CLI wizard, then be sure to install your dependencies before continuing.

## Adding the StudioCMS integration

To add the StudioCMS integration to your project, you'll need to install the Astro StudioCMS package and it's dependencies:

    <PackageManagers type="exec" pkg="astro" args="add db node studiocms" />

After installing the package, make sure that your `astro.config.mjs` file is correctly importing and calling the integration:

```js title="astro.config.mjs"
import db from '@astrojs/db';
import node from '@astrojs/node';
import studioCMS from 'studiocms';
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';

export default defineConfig({
    site: 'https://demo.astro-studiocms.xyz/',
    output: 'server',
    adapter: node({ mode: "standalone" }),
    integrations: [
        db(),
        studioCMS({
            dbStartPage: true, // After the first time running the dev server and following the instructions at http://localhost:4321/start this will be set to false.
        }),
    ],
});
```

<Aside type="note" title="SSR Only">
StudioCMS requires SSR mode to work correctly. Make sure to set `output: 'server'` and an adapter that supports SSR in your `astro.config.mjs` file.
</Aside>

## Configure your `package.json` scripts

Setup your `package.json` scripts to include the `--remote` flag for build, and optionally for dev. (You can also run the dev command as shown in the ["Running your StudioCMS Project"](#running-your-studiocms-project) section)

```json title="package.json"
{
    "name": "my-studiocms-project",
    "scripts": {
        "dev": "astro dev --remote",
        "build": "astro check & astro build --remote",
        "astro": "astro"
    }
}
```

## Running your StudioCMS project

Thanks to the power of Astro running StudioCMS is as easy as running the dev command for local preview, or building and deploying to your server, for the basics of how to use it locally without building here is what you need to do.

### First time Setup (or during updates if the tables schema is updated)

To start your Astro project, run the following commands in your terminal:

    <PackageManagers type="exec" args="astro db link #If using Astro Studio" />
    <PackageManagers type="exec" args="astro db push" />
    <PackageManagers type="run" args="dev --remote" />

After running the commands, you should see a message indicating that your project is running at `localhost:4321`. When first setting up StudioCMS, you will prompted to finish configuring StudioCMS at http://localhost:4321/start

### Running in Astro Development mode locally

To start your Astro project, run the following command in your terminal:

    <PackageManagers type="run" args="dev --remote" />

After running the command, you should see a message indicating that your project is running at `localhost:4321`. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4321` to see your Astro project in action.

**Congratulations!** ü•≥ You now have StudioCMS installed in your Astro project.

## Next steps

Now that you have StudioCMS installed, you can start building your project with StudioCMS.

Check out how to set environment variables in StudioCMS by heading to [Environment Variables](/start-here/environment-variables).

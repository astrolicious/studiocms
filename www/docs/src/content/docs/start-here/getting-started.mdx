## Let's get started

To start using Astro StudioCMS, you'll need:

- An Astro project
- An Astro Studio account
- An Astro Studio project
- The Astro StudioCMS integration

## Creating an Astro Studio account

You can create an Astro Studio account by visiting [Astro Studio](https://studio.astro.build/).

Once created, you'll be able to access the Astro Studio dashboard and manage your projects.

## Creating a new Studio project

There are two ways to create a project in Astro Studio:

To get started go to your personal dashboard within Studio and click the "Start a Project" button and follow the instructions. Astro Studio will connect to your GitHub repository and create a new hosted database for your project.

**Use the Astro Studio CLI** to create from any local Astro project. You can run the following commands to get started:

    <PackageManagers type="exec" pkg="astro" args="db login" comment="Log in to Astro Studio with your GitHub account"/>
    <PackageManagers type="exec" pkg="astro" args="db link" comment="Link to a new project by following the prompts"/>
    <PackageManagers type="exec" pkg="astro" args="db push" comment="Push your local db configuration to the remote database"/>

    Once you are logged in and linked successfully, you can run all Astro DB commands to manage your remote database. 

:::note
See [the Astro DB CLI reference](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/db/#astro-db-cli-reference) for all available commands.
:::

## Creating a new Astro project

To create a new Astro project, simply run the following command in your terminal:

    <PackageManagers type="create" pkg="astro" />

After running the command, you'll be prompted to answer a few questions about your project. Once completed, the CLI will create a new Astro project in the specified directory.

If all goes well, you should see a ‚ÄúLiftoff confirmed. Explore your project!‚Äù message followed by some recommended next steps.

`cd` into your new project directory to begin using Astro. `cd my-project`

If you skipped the npm install step during the CLI wizard, then be sure to install your dependencies before continuing.

## Adding the Astro StudioCMS integration

To add the Astro StudioCMS integration to your project, you'll need to install the Astro StudioCMS package and it's dependencies:

    <PackageManagers type="exec" pkg="astro" args="add @astrolicious/studiocms db node" />

After installing the package, make sure that your `astro.config.mjs` file is correctly importing and calling the integration:

```js title="astro.config.mjs"
import db from '@astrojs/db';
import node from '@astrojs/node';
import studioCMS from '@astrolicious/studiocms';
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';

export default defineConfig({
    site: 'https://demo.astro-studiocms.xyz/',
    output: 'server',
    adapter: node({ mode: "standalone" }),
    integrations: [
        db(),
        studioCMS({
            dbStartPage: true, // After the first time running the dev server and following the instructions at http://localhost:4321/start this will be set to false.
        }),
    ],
});
```

:::note
Astro StudioCMS requires SSR mode to work correctly. Make sure to set `output: 'server'` and an adapter that supports SSR in your `astro.config.mjs` file.

### Running your Astro project

To start your Astro project, run the following command in your terminal:

    <PackageManagers type="run" args="dev" />

After running the command, you should see a message indicating that your project is running at `localhost:4321`. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4321` to see your Astro project in action.

**Congratulations!** ü•≥ You now have Astro StudioCMS installed in your Astro project.

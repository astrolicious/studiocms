Astro is a content-focused framework. Features like content collections and the new content layer make it extremely easy to manage content of any size or form.

However, it is also a solution that basically requires you to be a developer, or at least have a decent amount of knowledge about how Astro uses the files you
put into your content directory. Also, the experience it provides is not something you can present to a client or any person just wanting an easy content 
managing experience. You need a CMS for that.

There's a lot of CMSs out there, with different flavors and features for your needs, but there is none that completely takes advantage of all of Astro's capabilities.
That's why StudioCMS exists: a CMS that is completely focused on Astro and that can hook into every single one of its features to provide a highly improved DX.

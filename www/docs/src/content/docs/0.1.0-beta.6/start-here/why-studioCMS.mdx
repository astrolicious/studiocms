We're so excited to introduce StudioCMS - a dedicated content management system (CMS) built on top of Astro's latest product: [Astro DB](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/astro-db/). This project was developed by [Adam](https://github.com/Adammatthiesen), [Dreyfus](https://github.com/dreyfus92), and [Jumper](https://github.com/jdtjenkins), three passionate members of the Astro community.

## Why another CMS?

While Astro's content capabilities are powerful, we recognized a need for a more streamlined and user-friendly CMS solution within the Astro ecosystem. Many Astro users, especially those coming from more traditional CMS backgrounds, have expressed a desire for a dedicated CMS that can seamlessly integrate with Astro projects.

StudioCMS was born out of this need, providing a content management platform that is tailor-made for Astro. By building on top of Astro Studio, we're able to offer a CMS experience that feels native to the Astro workflow, making it easier for both developers and content creators to collaborate on Astro-powered projects.

## An Experimental Endeavor

It's important to note that StudioCMS is an experimental project that heavily relies on the [@astrojs/db package](https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/main/packages/db), which is currently in active development and not yet considered stable. As a result, you should expect a significant number of breaking changes as the project continues to evolve.

We believe that by building on the cutting-edge features of Astro Db, we can create a powerful and innovative CMS solution. However, this also means that StudioCMS may not be suitable for mission-critical or production-ready projects at this stage. We encourage you to use caution and thoroughly test the CMS in your own projects before deploying it to a live environment.

## Key Features

* **Part of Astrolicious:** Astrolicious leverages Astro's robust and efficient framework, providing a solid base for building and scaling applications.

* **Realtime Markdown Editor:** StudioCMS has a real-time Markdown editor so you can create your content using powerful Markdown syntax and see changes reflected in real-time!

* **Enhanced Markdown:** We've incorporated 'Marked' with support for extensions, enriching the markdown experience with greater flexibility and functionality.

* **Shiki Syntax Highlighting:** StudioCMS offers Shiki-powered syntax highlighting, ensuring your code is both visually appealing and easy to read. This is especially useful in non-Cloudflare environments due to bundle size considerations.

* **Markdoc Integration:** In addition to 'Marked', StudioCMS provides an alternative with Markdoc, offering users a choice for their markdown processing needs.

* **Secure libSQL Database:** All data is securely housed within the Astro Studio database, ensuring access only to authorized users with `studio.astro.build` login credentials. Or you can use your own libSQL server.

* **Built-in Authentication:** StudioCMS features built-in authentication with support for multiple platforms, including Local and Github, enhancing security and user management (currently in development).

* **Unpic Image Service:** StudioCMS includes a free and efficient image service, Unpic, which makes managing external URLs straightforward, with support for major CDNs.

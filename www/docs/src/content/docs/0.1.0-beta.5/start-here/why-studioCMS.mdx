We're so excited to introduce AstroStudio CMS - a dedicated content management system (CMS) built on top of Astro's latest product: [Astro Studio](https://studio.astro.build). This project was developed by [Adam](https://github.com/Adammatthiesen), [Dreyfus](https://github.com/dreyfus92), and [Jumper](https://github.com/jdtjenkins), three passionate members of the Astro community.

## Why another CMS?

While Astro's content capabilities are powerful, we recognized a need for a more streamlined and user-friendly CMS solution within the Astro ecosystem. Many Astro users, especially those coming from more traditional CMS backgrounds, have expressed a desire for a dedicated CMS that can seamlessly integrate with Astro projects.

AstroStudio CMS was born out of this need, providing a content management platform that is tailor-made for Astro. By building on top of Astro Studio, we're able to offer a CMS experience that feels native to the Astro workflow, making it easier for both developers and content creators to collaborate on Astro-powered projects.

## An Experimental Endeavor

It's important to note that AstroStudio CMS is an experimental project that heavily relies on the [@astrojs/db package](https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/main/packages/db), which is currently in active development and not yet considered stable. As a result, you should expect a significant number of breaking changes as the project continues to evolve.

We believe that by building on the cutting-edge features of Astro Studio, we can create a powerful and innovative CMS solution. However, this also means that AstroStudio CMS may not be suitable for mission-critical or production-ready projects at this stage. We encourage you to use caution and thoroughly test the CMS in your own projects before deploying it to a live environment.

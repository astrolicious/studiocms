# Introduction

#### Powered by [`astro-theme-provider`](https://github.com/astrolicious/astro-theme-provider) by [Bryce Russell](https://github.com/BryceRussell)

This Astro integration enables the StudioCMS Blog feature in your Astro project. This integration will allow you to create, edit, and delete blog posts in the StudioCMS dashboard.

## Installation

<PackageManagers type="exec" pkg="astro" args="add @astrolicious/studiocms-blog" />

## Usage

### What does this integration do?

This integration will add the following new routes to your StudioCMS Controlled Front-end:

- `/blog` - The main blog page that lists all blog posts.
- `/blog/[slug]` - The individual blog post page.
- `/rss.xml` - The RSS feed for your blog posts.

### Example config

```js title="astro.config.mjs"
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import db from '@astrojs/db';
import studioCMS from '@astrolicious/studiocms';
import studioCMSBlog from '@astrolicious/studiocms-blog';

// https://astro.build/config
export default defineConfig({
  site: "https://example.com",
  output: "server",
  adapter: ...
  integrations: [ 
    db(), // REQUIRED - `@astrojs/db` must be included in the integrations list
    studioCMS(), // REQUIRED - StudioCMS must be included in the integrations list
    studioCMSBlog({
      config: {
        title: "My StudioCMS Blog",
        description: "A Simple Blog build with Astro, Astrojs/DB, and StudioCMS.".
      },
    }), 
  ],
});

The Package Catalog is a collection of packages by StudioCMS or its community members, that are not included within StudioCMS by default. All packages listed here are verified and tested by the StudioCMS team or its contributors.

Any package labeled as a <Badge text="Plugin" variant="tip"/> is a package that extends the functionality of StudioCMS or its dashboard.

Any package labled as <Badge text="Publicly Usable" variant="caution"/> is able to be installed and used in projects that do not rely on studiocms. They can work on their own.

The Package Catalog is a collection of packages by StudioCMS or its community members, that are not included within StudioCMS by default. All packages listed here are verified and tested by the StudioCMS team or its contributors.

Any package labeled as a <Badge text="Plugin" variant="tip"/> *(on the sidebar)* is a package that extends the functionality of StudioCMS or its dashboard.

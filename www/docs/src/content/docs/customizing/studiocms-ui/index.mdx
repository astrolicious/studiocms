import { PackageManagers } from 'starlight-package-managers';

`@studiocms/ui` is the UI library that we use to build StudioCMS. The library is agnostic, meaning that you can use it
in your own Astro projects! 

You can install it from npm:

<PackageManagers type="add" pkg="@studiocms/ui" />

All of these components can be tested in our [UI playground](https://ui-testing.studiocms.xyz/).

## Importing Components

All components this library are exported from `@studiocms/ui/components`. You can import and use the components like this:

```astro
---
import { Button } from '@studiocms/ui/components';
---

<Button />
```

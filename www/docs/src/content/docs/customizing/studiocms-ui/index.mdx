import PackageManagers from '~/components/PackageManagers.astro';

`@studiocms/ui` is the UI library that we use to build StudioCMS. The library is agnostic, meaning that you can use it
in your own Astro projects! 

You can install it from npm:

<PackageManagers type="add" pkg="@studiocms/ui" />

All of these components can be tested in our [UI playground](https://ui-testing.studiocms.xyz/).

## Importing Components

All components this library are exported from `@studiocms/ui/components`. You can import and use the components like this:

```astro
---
import { Button } from '@studiocms/ui/components';
---

<Button />
```

Include the styles by importing `@studiocms/ui/styles/global.css` in your page layout.

```astro
---
import '@studiocms/ui/styles/global.css';
---
```

:::danger[About Accessibility]
As of right now, `@studiocms/ui` is nowhere near being accessible. We are still missing crucial support for keyboard navigation,
screen readers etc. This is by design, as although this library is publicly accessible, we still focus on building StudioCMS with it.

We will add support for keyboard navigation and screenreaders at a later time, once we perform the planned accessibility audit for StudioCMS.
Should you however want to contribute, and add these features yourself, feel free to!

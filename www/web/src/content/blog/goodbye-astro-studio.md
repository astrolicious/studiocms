## StudioCMS: Thriving Beyond Astro Studio

With the recent announcement from Astro that Astro Studio will be winding down, we understand that many in the Astro community may be wondering what this means for projects and platforms built around AstroDB, including our very own **StudioCMS**. While Astro Studio, the hosted libSQL database platform, may be closing its doors, **StudioCMS will not only survive but continue to thrive, grow, and serve the Astro ecosystem**—with even more determination than before.

### StudioCMS and the Legacy of Astro Studio

StudioCMS was inspired by Astro Studio’s vision of providing a powerful SQL-based backend within the Astro ecosystem. Though Astro Studio will soon wind down, the **concept and ambition behind StudioCMS** remain stronger than ever. Our mission has always been to offer an intuitive, streamlined CMS specifically for the Astro community, and that mission extends well beyond Astro Studio’s lifespan.

### What’s Next for StudioCMS

While Astro Studio’s hosted database platform will sunset, **StudioCMS is built to adapt**. With AstroDB’s new direction of allowing connections to any libSQL database (including platforms like Turso), we see this as an opportunity to continue delivering an optimized CMS experience, regardless of the underlying database infrastructure.

Our roadmap remains laser-focused on providing:
- **Flexibility**: StudioCMS will support any libSQL-compatible backend, including Turso, self-hosted solutions, or alternative databases that fit your needs.
- **Seamless integration with Astro projects**: As always, StudioCMS is designed to feel native within the Astro workflow, enabling both developers and content creators to manage content effortlessly.
- **Community-driven development**: We will continue to build StudioCMS in collaboration with the Astro community, ensuring that it evolves based on your feedback and needs.

### A Tribute to Astro Studio and a Look Ahead

Astro Studio was a major inspiration behind the creation of StudioCMS, and its approach to easy, scalable SQL data storage was pivotal for us. While we bid farewell to Astro Studio, we’re excited about the opportunity this shift provides. By broadening the scope to connect with any libSQL database, **StudioCMS will continue to grow and flourish** as a dedicated CMS solution for Astro.

### Our Commitment to the Astro Community

We are deeply committed to the **Astro ecosystem** and the community that has made it so vibrant. StudioCMS will continue to push forward with its mission to become the main CMS solution for Astro developers, empowering content creators and development teams alike to collaborate seamlessly on Astro-powered projects.

To the Astro Studio users and the wider Astro community, we invite you to join us on this journey of innovation and growth. Together, we’ll ensure that StudioCMS remains a vital part of the ecosystem, thriving well into the future.

**Join us on this journey!**

Stay tuned for updates as we provide information on how StudioCMS will transition to support the new changes in AstroDB. We’re excited to build a platform that stands the test of time and evolves alongside the Astro framework.

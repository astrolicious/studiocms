TL;DR: [Turso](https://turso.tech) has become the first official sponsor of StudioCMS!

---

Hey all! Work on StudioCMS has continued to progress smoothly. As we continue to evolve within the Astro ecosystem, we're incredibly excited to announce that **[Turso](https://turso.tech)** has agreed to sponsor our endeavour. Thanks to them, we'll have access to a robust, hosted database solution which will allow us to enjoy a smoother experience building StudioCMS.

## Why Turso?
With the recent announcement that [Astro Studio will be sunsetting](https://astro.build/blog/goodbye-astro-studio/) later this year, we needed a provider to switch to. Turso emerged as a natural choice - after all, we were technically already using their services under the guise of Astro Studio itself! The team *(and by that I mean Adam)* has been really excited about Turso for a while, and so we're incredibly grateful that they've given us access to their Scaler plan. This will allow as to scale up our efforts, alongside Turso's incredible libSQL databases.

## What does this mean for StudioCMS?
Not much, actually! We'll continue to operate as we do now, with the only difference being that we now officially use Turso, and not "just" Astro Studio. We'll continue to work along the same [public roadmap](https://studiocms.xyz/roadmap), and continue to build __the__ CMS for the Astro ecosystem. Turso simply makes it easier for our team to experiment, run demos, make small changes and continue pushing the project in the direction the community feels is right.

*Speaking of, should you want to sponsor us too, feel free! You can do so on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/astrolicious/studiocms), right hand side, "Sponsor this project" section* ðŸ˜‰

## What's next?
Our main goal has not changed, and we'll continue to strive to bring you the best CMS for Astro possible! We've got some big things in the works, including a **dashboard redesign** *(championed by yours truly)* and adjacent **UI library**, a backend rewrite which ties into the former, and lots of other little things - you might have noticed our **small landing page rework** recently! 

Feel free to check out any active PRs on [GitHub](https://github.com/astrolicious/studiocms) or join our [Discord Server](https://chat.studiocms.xyz/) for more information on what's happening in the StudioCMS ecosystem at the moment.

Again, big thanks to [Turso](https://turso.tech) for being the first official sponsor of StudioCMS! We'll be back with more news soon. Until then!

â€” The StudioCMS Team

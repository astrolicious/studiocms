### StudioCMS: New Domain, Modular Structure & NPM Package Names!

Greetings, StudioCMS users!

We are excited to announce some updates to the StudioCMS project that reflect our growing commitment to becoming a more recognizable and robust tool for the Astro ecosystem. While we’re still proudly a part of the Astrolicious organization, we’ve made changes to our branding that will make StudioCMS stand out more as a dedicated offering.

Here’s what’s new:

---

#### 1. **New NPM Package Names & Modularization**
Previously, you might have installed StudioCMS via packages like `@astrolicious/studiocms` or `@astrolicious/studiocms-blog`. To streamline our branding and make our packages easier to find and use, we’ve updated these names:

- `@astrolicious/studiocms` → **`studiocms`**
- `@astrolicious/studiocms-blog` → **`@studiocms/blog`**

In addition to the renaming, we’ve broken down the main integration into smaller, more modular parts. StudioCMS now consists of **11 packages**, including those already listed. These packages are essential components of the main `studiocms` package, allowing for better flexibility and future scalability.

All future plugins built by StudioCMS will also be published under the `@studiocms/` npm scope.

---

#### 2. **New Domain: studiocms.xyz**
To further align with our new branding, we’ve also changed our domain from `astro-studiocms.xyz` to **`studiocms.xyz`**. We believe this new domain reflects our mission to provide a seamless and professional CMS experience for Astro developers.

Please update your bookmarks and remember to visit us at [studiocms.xyz](https://studiocms.xyz) for all documentation and resources!

### Why These Changes?

Our goal with StudioCMS has always been to create an intuitive, community-driven CMS that fully leverages the power of Astro. As the project has evolved, it has become clear that a distinct identity is essential. These changes will help increase our visibility in the Astro community, making it easier for developers and content creators to find and adopt StudioCMS in their projects.

### What’s Next?

We’re committed to continuous improvements. The core of StudioCMS remains the same, and we’ll continue focusing on building features that make content management easier for Astro-powered projects.

Thank you for being part of this journey. If you have any questions, join our community on [Discord](https://chat.studiocms.xyz) or check out our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/astrolicious/studiocms).

Let’s keep building the future of content management together!

Recently, we welcomed one of our newest community members into the StudioCMS family, not just as a contributor, but as a **development team member** — [Louis Escher](https://github.com/louisescher). Louis has brought an incredible skill set to our project, especially in the realm of design!

### New Dashboard Design and Overhaul

One of Louis’s first goals when he started contributing to StudioCMS was to **completely redesign and overhaul our dashboard**. But he didn’t stop there! Along with the new dashboard, Louis also played a key role in our branding update, ensuring that our visual identity reflects the forward-thinking nature of StudioCMS.

Additionally, Louis has helped spearhead a full **internal logic overhaul** of the dashboard. This effort will simplify the user experience while providing developers with more complex and flexible functionality. You can follow the discussion on this exciting redesign [here on GitHub](https://github.com/astrolicious/studiocms/discussions/294).

### Introducing `@studiocms/ui`

One of Louis’s biggest contributions so far has been the creation of the brand-new **`@studiocms/ui` component library**. This library is at the heart of the dashboard’s redesign, providing reusable, modular components that make it easier for developers to customize and expand the dashboard. 

The `@studiocms/ui` component library will be released with `studiocms` version `0.1.0-beta.8` along with the dashboard redesign.

We are excited for the future of StudioCMS, and with contributors like Louis, our journey to deliver a powerful and user-friendly CMS experience continues to evolve. Stay tuned for more updates, and be sure to check out the new dashboard soon!
